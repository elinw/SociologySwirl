  Lesson: The Mean and the Variance
  Author: Elin Waring
  Type: Standard
  Organization: Soc 345
  Version: 2.4.2

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson we will continue to learn about the mean using the chickwts data set.
     We will also learn about a key measure of variation called the variance.
     Some additional variables have been added, median_weight (the median value of weight) and weight_deviation_median
     which is the value of weight minus the median of weight.

- Class: text
  Output: In the previous lesson we saw that if you subtract the mean from all
    of the values for a variable, both the sum and the mean of the new values will be 0.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What happens if we take the sum of the differences between
    the values and the median? Use the weight_deviation_median variable to get this.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(chickwts$weight_deviation_median)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum(chickwts$weight_deviation_median)')
  Hint: Use the sum function and the dataset$variable notation.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What if we calculate the mean of the differences from the median?
  CorrectAnswer: mean(chickwts$weight_deviation_median)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(chickwts$weight_deviation_median)')
  Hint: Use the mean function and the dataset$variable notation.

- Class: text
  Output: Notice that neither the sum nor the mean is 0. The only time they
    would be 0 would be if the mean and median were equal to each other.
    The mean is the only statistic that will always give you a sum and mean of
    0 for the deviations.

- Class: text
  Output: However, as you can see, if we want to know, on average, how far
    specific weights are from the center of the weights, the mean deviation does not help us
    much since it is always 0.
    In reality, in terms of how far away observations are from the center we
    do not care if they are above or below the mean. This is just like saying
    that when we want to know how many blocks the subway is from our home, we do
    not care if the blocks take us to the north or south, we only care how many there
    are.

- Class: text
  Output: The most obvious way to meaningfully measure how far an observation is
    from the mean is to use the absolute value instead of the value with a sign.
    Remember that the absolute value removes the sign, meaning that all numbers are
    treated as positive.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Calculate the mean of the absolute value of weight_deviation by
    using mean(abs(chickwts$weight_deviation)). Recall that abs() is the absolute
    value function.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(abs(chickwts$weight_deviation))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(abs(chickwts$weight_deviation))')
  Hint: Copy the code mean(abs(chickwts$weight_deviation)).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Calculate the mean of the absolute value of weight_deviation_median.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(abs(chickwts$weight_deviation_median))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(abs(chickwts$weight_deviation_median))')
  Hint: Follow the pattern from the previous question but change the variable name.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which is smaller, the mean absolute deviation around the  mean or the median?
  AnswerChoices: Around the median;Around the mean;They are the same.
  CorrectAnswer: Around the median
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Around the median')
  Hint: Compare the values for the two previous answers.

- Class: text
  Output: The mean absolute deviation will be smaller around the median than
     any other value. The values for mean and median will only be tied if the
     mean and median are equal.

- Class: text
  Output: The other main approach to describing the mean distance of observations
     from the center of a distribution is to square the distances. This also always
     gives a positive number. It also has some other advantages that we will not
     go into here.

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to read a web discussion about why many people prefer
     squaring but use the absolute value?

- Class: text
  Output: The important thing to know is that statisticians use both approaches
     with the choice depending on what they are doing.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:    Calculate the mean of the square of weight_deviation by
     using mean(chickwts$weight_deviation^2). Recall that ^2 means to
     raise to the second power (square) the value.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(chickwts$weight_deviation^2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(chickwts$weight_deviation^2)')
  Hint: Copy the code mean(chickwts$weight_deviation^2).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:    Calculate the mean of the square of weight_deviation_median.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(chickwts$weight_deviation_median^2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(chickwts$weight_deviation_median^2)')
  Hint: Follow the pattern from the previous question but change the variable name.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which is smaller, the squared deviation around the  mean or the median?
  AnswerChoices: Around the median;Around the mean;They are the same.
  CorrectAnswer: Around the mean
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Around the mean')
  Hint: Compare the values for the two previous answers.

- Class: text
  Output: The mean squared deviation will always be smaller around the mean than
     any other value. The values for mean and median will only be tied if the
    mean and median are equal.

- Class: text
  Output: The mean squared deviation has a special name, which is the variance.
     Sometimes you will see this formula referred to as the population variance.

- Class: text
  Output: If we had just added up the squared deviations without dividing by
     the sample size, that number is often called the sum of squares
     or total sum of squares.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The square root of the variance is called the standard deviation or
     sometimes called the population standard deviation. Calculate the standard
     deviation by putting the variance formula for weight_deviation inside the sqrt() function.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(mean(chickwts$weight_deviation^2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(mean(chickwts$weight_deviation^2))')
  Hint: The formula should look like sqrt(mean(variable^2))

- Class: text
  Output: The standard deviation is very useful because by taking the square root
     of the variance you return to the original units, in this case grams.

- Class: text
  Output:  R has functions sd() and var() to calculate the standard deviation and
    variance.  What happens when we use them?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the var function on weight_deviation
  CorrectAnswer: var(chickwts$weight_deviation)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='var(chickwts$weight_deviation)')
  Hint: Put the variable name inside the var() function using the dataset$variable notation.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How do the two calculations of variance compare?
  AnswerChoices: The var() version is higher; The mean() version is higher; The two versions are the same.
  CorrectAnswer: The var() version is higher
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'The var() version is higher')
  Hint: hint

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The var() command will always give a higher variance estimate than calculating the mean
      of the squared deviations. Type ?var to load the help page for var().
  CorrectAnswer: ?var
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?var')
  Hint: Type ?var

- Class: mult_question
  Output:  In the Details section at about paragraph 7, it starts The denominator.
     What value is used for the denominator?
  AnswerChoices: n-1;n;n+1
  CorrectAnswer: n-1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'n-1')
  Hint: Look in the help file.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: A variance calculated with n-1 in the denominator instead of n is sometimes
     called the sample variance.  Why would dividing by n-1 give a bigger value than
     dividing by n?
  AnswerChoices: Because dividing by a smaller number gives a bigger result;Because the sample size is smaller;Neither of these reasons
  CorrectAnswer: Because dividing by a smaller number gives a bigger result
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Because dividing by a smaller number gives a bigger result')
  Hint: hint

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Multiply the var() results for weight_deviation by (n-1)/n which can
    be expressed as (nrow(chickwts)-1)/nrow(chickwts)
  CorrectAnswer: var(chickwts$weight_deviation)*(nrow(chickwts)-1)/nrow(chickwts)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='var(chickwts$weight_deviation)*(nrow(chickwts)-1)/nrow(chickwts)')
  Hint: Start with var(chickwts$weight_deviation)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Calculate the variance for weight.
  CorrectAnswer: var(chickwts$weight)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='var(chickwts$weight)')
  Hint: Put chickwts$weight inside var().

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How does the variance of weight compare to the variance of weight_deviation?
  AnswerChoices: They are the same;Variance of weight is higher;Variance of weight_deviation is higher
  CorrectAnswer: They are the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'They are the same')
  Hint: Compare the value in the previous question to the one for weight_deviation.

- Class: text
  Output: The two variances are the same because the formula for variance builds in
     subtracting the mean from each observation. That is, the formula converts the weight
      values into weight_deviation values. On the other hand, since the mean of weight_deviation
      is 0, subtracting it from the weight_deviation values has no impact. So you end
      up with the same numbers being used in the calculation.

      The variance and the sum of squares are very widely used in statistics.
