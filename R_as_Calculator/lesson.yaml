- Class: text
  Output: One way we will use R is as a calculator. Let's start by trying the four basic operations.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Addition ..  Type 7+2 at the prompt below.
  CorrectAnswer: 7 + 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='7 + 2')
  Hint: Type 7 + 2 and then hit enter or return.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Subtraction ..  Type 7 - 2
  CorrectAnswer: 7 - 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='7 - 2')
  Hint:  Just type 7 - 2.



- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's multiply 7 * 2
  CorrectAnswer: 7 * 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='7*2')
  Hint: Use * to indicate multiplication.



- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The final basic operation is division represented by / ... 7/2
  CorrectAnswer: 7/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='7/2')
  Hint: The / is the symbol for division.

- Class: text
  Output: Two other common operations on a calculator are raising a number
          to a power and taking a square root. Let's try them.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To raise one number to a power use the ^ operator.  Try 2^7   (^ is Shift 6 on you r keyboard)
  CorrectAnswer: 2^7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2^7')
  Hint: Type 2^7 to raise 2 to the 7th power.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now raise 7 to the 2nd power
  CorrectAnswer: '7 ^ 2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='7^2')
  Hint: Use ^ to indicate that you are raising a number to a power.



- Class: cmd_question
  Output: There isn't a simple equivalent to the radical sign for square root, so we use sqrt(7)
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(7)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(7)')
  Hint: Make sure to check you spelling and parentheses.



- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just like on most calculators using the sqrt() function on a negative number gives a kind of error. Try taking the square root of -7.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(-7)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(-7)')
  Hint: Type sqrt(-7).



- Class: text
  Output: As you can see, just like most calculators sqrt() will not calculate the square root of a negative number, and instead gives NaN (not a number).  (R can also give a complex number as the answer, but that's for another lesson.)



- Class: text
  Output: One more useful math operation is absolute value. Just like with square root, there isn't a
          simple symbol so we use abs().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the absolute value of 14
  CorrectAnswer: 'abs(14)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='abs(14)')
  Hint: Use abs() by putting the number inside the parentheses.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the absolute value of -14
  CorrectAnswer: 'abs(-14)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='abs(-14)')
  Hint: Use abs() by putting the number inside the parentheses.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Like most computer languages, R differs from a calculator in how it uses equal signs.  There is a special operator ==  (a double equal sign) that asks are two entities equal to each other. For example try typing 2 + 2 == 2*2
  CorrectAnswer: '2 + 2 == 2*2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2 + 2 == 2*2')
  Hint: Don't forget to use two equal signs right next to each other, ==.

- Class: text
  Output: The answer is TRUE because 2 + 2 and 2*2 both are equal to 4, and they are equal to each other.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's try two things that are not equal to each other, 2 == 100
  CorrectAnswer: '2 == 100'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2 == 100')
  Hint: Don't forget to use two equal signs right next to each other, ==.

- Class: text
  Output: Unlike simple calculators, but like scientific calculators, R can
          combine operations together and uses parentheses to make sure the
          calculations work correctly.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's add a bunch of numbers together and square the result by typing (3+2+5+4)^2
  CorrectAnswer: '(3+2+5+4)^2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(3+2+5+4)^2')
  Hint: Type (3+2+5+4)^2 exactly.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now try it without parentheses 3+2+5+4^2
  CorrectAnswer: '3+2+5+4^2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='3+2+5+4^2')
  Hint: Make sure you copy the formula exactly 3+2+5+4^2.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Why do 3+2+5+4^2 and (3+2+5+4)^2 give different answers?
  AnswerChoices:  All of these statements are right; Because the 3+2+5+4^2 is the same as 3+2+5+16; Because (3+2+5+4)^2 is the same as 14^2; Because you do the operations inside the parentheses first
  CorrectAnswer: All of these statements are right
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'All of these statements are right')
  Hint: Try

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Using order of operations, what is the first step of solving (4-6)^2 ?
  AnswerChoices: Calculate 4-6; Square both 4 and 6; Multiply both 4 and 6 by 2
  CorrectAnswer: Calculate 4-6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Calculate 4-6')
  Hint: Start with doing the calculation inside the parentheses.

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a short video about order of operations?

- Class: text
  Output: For all the basic operations, R follows the same order of operation rules that you normally use in math problems--
          First do calculations inside of parentheses, then calulate any exponents, then multiply and divide, then add and subtract.
          you are inside  parentheses follow the same rules again. If there are many sets of parentheses you need to start at the
          inside and work your way out, always following the rules.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the correct way to solve this ((9-10)^2 + (11-10)^2)/2
  AnswerChoices: Do the subtraction, then the exponents, then the division, then the addition. ;  Do the division, then the exponents. then the subtraction, then the addtion. ; Divide the exponents by 2, then do the subtraction, followed by the addition.;Do the subtractions, then the exponents, then the addition, then the division.
  CorrectAnswer: 'Do the subtractions, then the exponents, then the addition, then the division.'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Do the subtractions, then the exponents, then the addition, then the division.')
  Hint: Remember to always complete everything inside the innermost parentheses before working on the next step.  Pay attention to all of the parentheses.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's do one more problem ... calculate (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) + (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + (2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)
  CorrectAnswer: '(2 + 3 + 4 + 5) + (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + (2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(2 + 3 + 4 + 5) + (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + (2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)')
  Hint: You have to copy carefully!

- Class: text
  Output: Wait a minute, did you notice something about that last question?  We typed the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5  three times!
          That seems silly, surely there must be a better way ... as we shall see in the next lesson.
